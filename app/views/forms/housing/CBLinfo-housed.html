    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Can the person live alone?</strong> if so, then we should ask and bypass the next page</li>
      <li>this is a possible information page to add to provide guidance about the pages coming after (info about each person living with the main applicant)</li>
      <li>the content should be drafted by sharon and agreed by Housing - Usability testing would help to see what is needed</li>
      <li> we could add guidance about the meaning of joint applicant? pregnancy? adult / child status  for 16-18</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>There are a lot of potential flaws the moment:</strong></p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>should the main applicant add themselves here? - I assumed not so captured the info previously (DOB and gender)</li>
      <li>where do you enter children living with you permanently?</li>
      <li>pregnancy: what if it's twins or more? teen pregnancy? main applicant is pregnant?</li>
      <li>number for the adult label: There is an 'adult 1' on the 'pregnancy page' and the same number appear on the 'not pregnant' page = confusing!</li>
    </ul>
