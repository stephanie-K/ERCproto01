    <p>The content is new but still been worked on, we will refer to the original application form , this is just to illustrate that we will address the priorities grouped after this point, with some guidance here. </p>
    <p>After this page, we remove all texts which was there previously mentioning "if your catchment school is full" to avoid adding stress by repetition.</p>
    <p>Heather's note: with this statement it would be helpful to refer the applicant to the policy again</p>
    <p>We might explain None option here - in reference to paragraph 3? </p>
